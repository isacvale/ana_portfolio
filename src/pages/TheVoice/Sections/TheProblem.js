        The Langara Voice, Langara Collegeâ€™s newspaper and news website, wanted
        to benefit from the advantages of a PWA, such as offline accessibility,
        and faster loading. The website needed to adapt the interface to allow
        for it, and inform the users how to better take advantage of the
        feature.

        The journalism department said they did not want us to make major
        changes to the interface since they were happy with it.
